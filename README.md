## Project Overview
The FMCG Customer Retention Analytics Dashboard project aims to improve customer retention by analyzing and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) related to On-Time (OT) and In-Full (IF) deliveries, as well as the combined OTIF (On-Time, In-Full) performance. The dashboard specifically focuses on two key customers in Surat and Vadodara, who have below-target OTIF and OT percentages. This analysis helps identify trends and areas for improvement in delivery performance to address service lapses.

## Technologies Used
- **Data Visualization:** Power BI
- **Data Sources:** Excel, CSV files, or ERP systems

## Data Sources
- On-time delivery records
- In-full delivery records
- OTIF performance logs

## Data Modeling
- Data from various sources was imported and transformed using Power Query in Power BI.
- Relationships between tables were created to enable a comprehensive analysis of OT, IF, and OTIF performance.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **On-Time (OT) Percentage:** The ratio of deliveries completed on or before the scheduled time to the total number of deliveries.
- **In-Full (IF) Percentage:** The proportion of deliveries completed with full quantities as requested.
